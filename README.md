# Reinforcement_Learning

Some studies/projects related to Reinforcement Learning.

The most interesting ones (in my opinion, of course) are:

* Q-learning-studies.Ipynb: a study of decaying learning rates and exploratoin probabilities for a Q-learning Agent, providing a heuristic for the characteristic decaying time as a function of the environment and investigating the impact of asymptotic asymptotic parameter values. Tested on a FrozenLake8x8-v0 environment.
